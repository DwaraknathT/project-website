title: Physics-informed Surrogate ML Models

description: |
  Building on the success of methods such as Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and Equivariant Neural Networks in predicting properties of crystalline solids as well as software packages for molecular machine learning such as DeepChem, we are developing software to combine these techniques to rapidly and accurately predict energetics of the adsorption processes critical to catalysis of reactions such as nitrogen reduction, as well as to screen novel electrolyte molecules and blends.
