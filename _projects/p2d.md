title: Cell-scale battery modeling (P2D/DFN models)

description: |
  We are generating cell-scale battery models from porous-electrode theory (such as the P2D/DFN model) from [PyBaMM](pybamm.org) in ModelingToolkit.jl to leverage the simulating power of the SciML ecosystem - either using Method of Lines (finite differences then ODE/DAE solvers) or by surrogatization with Physics-Informed Neural Networks. We will also develop hybrid models that directly incorporate experimental data into the models.
